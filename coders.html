        <h2>
		   About the Founders of the Schoolhouse
		</h2>
		<p>The Schoolhouse is a diverse community committed to
		advancing social justice and access to education.
		We hold a shared belief that every person has the potential
		to make positive change in their lives, despite even the most challenging
		circumstances, and believe that education is a critical tool in this process.
		Between 2006-2011, as asylum seekers from Sudan and Eritrea,Ivory Coast,Ghana,Nigeria, Guinea,Congo e.t.c 
		entered Israel,
		the Israeli government was unprepared as to how to approach this new migration challenge.
		The struggles on behalf of human rights organizations focused on survival needs,
		psycho-social attention, policy change, medical treatment and more.
		   Yet many voices from the Sudanese and Eritrea communities were asking for 
		   education and were speaking of education as a tool through which they believed
		   they could make a positive change in their lives.The Schoolhouse was created in
		   order to develop adult education and skills adapted to the particular
		   needs of these communities and in January 2012 the first English
		   class began with the support of HIAS and Windows for Peace.Our primary mission is to advance education,
		   practical skills and opportunity for these individuals who dream beyond the barriers that stand in their way,
		   to make an impact on their future and on the future of their communities.
